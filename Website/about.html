				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Nestled in the heart of the Hudson Valley,  Nimai’s Bliss Kitchen is the brainchild of a group of doctors who realized through their years of experiences with patients that a wholesome, health conscious diet is the best possible defense against a myriad of diseases. For this reason, Nimai’s Bliss Kitchen was created to provide our community with a distinctive, nutritious alternative and to change the bad rep that healthy food gets : that its too complicated, too bland, or too expensive.  Teaming up with chefs from India and the USA, we’ve created a nourishing, flavorful menu to delight your tastebuds, cleanse your body, and be easy on your wallet.<p> 
				<h3>Environmentally Aware</h3>
				<p>We take our love for the planet very seriously and pledge not to use any type of non-recyclable product in our business. We are always looking for new ways to cut down the toll we take on the environment and its inhabitants.</p>
				<h3>Our Menu</h3>
				<p>Nimai’s Bliss Kitchen is not your typical vegetarian restaurant; we offer a variety of choices that appeal to the tastes of herbivores and carnivores alike. Our menus are built off various seasonally available ingredients.</p>
				<h3>Our Ingredients</h3>
				<p>We use 100% natural ingredients in all of our dishes. We use no preservatives, canned or frozen ingredients whatsoever.  We have made partnerships with local farmers to get as much fresh produce as possible, and our dairy comes from an all-natural, beyond organic, and cruelty-free farm located in central Pennsylvania, the Gita Nagari Yoga Farm(hyperlink). In addition, all of our ingredients are 100% slaughter and cruelty free. We pride ourselves in using products that are not harmful in any way to the body, mind and spirit.</p>
